# Finding the Best Place to Open a Business in Yogyakarta

## Introduction

Yogyakarta is a popular tourist destination in Indonesia, dubbed as a city of students and culture. There are more than 50 urban areas and 20 universities located in Inner Yogyakarta. Of course, choosing a location for business is one of the stressful and controversial tasks, since there is a lot of criteria that should be satisfied in order to achieve the highest revenue. \

The target audience of this report is any one that is interested in opening a business but have no idea what kind of and in which area.

## Data

In this project, three different datasets will be used to solve the problem: Urban Area, College Area, and Popular Venue. Urban data were obtained from the Indonesian Postal Code. A list of colleges is obtained by scraping website of Ministry of Education and Culture. After that Geocode each area using Open Street Map to obtain coordinates (latitude and longitude). Finally, Foursquare API was used to call the top 100 popular venues based on the coordinates of each area.
